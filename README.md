# Grocery-Management-System-using-MySQL
The "Grocery Management System" is a comprehensive project that aims to streamline and enhance the management of grocery stores. This system is designed to simplify the process of inventory management, sales tracking, and customer interactions within a grocery store setting.

Technologically, the project utilizes a combination of frontend and backend tools. The frontend interface is developed using HTML for creating the structure, CSS for designing the layout, and JavaScript for adding interactive elements. On the other hand, the backend is built using the Python Flask framework, which allows for the creation of robust and scalable web applications. The project integrates a MySQL database to store and manage various data points such as product information, customer details, and transaction records.

By employing these technologies, the Grocery Management System aims to improve operational efficiency, facilitate better customer service, and provide a seamless shopping experience for both customers and store managers alike.
